# file-unmesser

B. D. - Twitter: @bitobrian

  A program to remove unwanted files in the Windows operating system. Evolved from a failed PowerShell script.
  
  I had a folder of rom files with muliple versions. I only 
wanted U.S. versions and only one per title. This allows you to target
a directory and type in a string like "(J)" - for Japanese games - to 
remove them.
  Originally I had a PowerShell script written to do this easily. I tried
several different methods of Remove-Item and could not get it to remove
certain files. Perfect excuse to write a program!
       
  Copy and paste a folder location from Windows Explorer in the exe.config 
before running.
